              Theories of management help develop leadership approaches that
              typically guide the growth of organisations, and you can choose
              from them to identify strategies that work best for you and your
              team. Understanding and applying these theories requires practice
              and may involve a certain amount of trial and error. Understanding
              and applying the best practices using these theories can help you

              This method recommends using the scientific method to perform
              tasks in the workplace rather than relying on the judgement or the
              personal discretion of team members. This involves task
              simplification to boost productivity. Leaders assign team members
              to jobs that are suitable for them, train them thoroughly and
              supervise them to ensure that they are effective in their roles.
              The emphasis of this theory is on maximising workplace efficiency
              by determining the best way to complete a task.
